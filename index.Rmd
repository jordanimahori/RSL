# Intro {.sidebar}

This dashboard covers materials for a course introducing R -- focusing on its use in calculating trade statistics.

Material adopted from [Femke van den Bos](https://github.com/femkevdbos/RGhana), [Gerko Vink](https://github.com/gerkovink/R), Statistics Denmark and [Laurent Smeets](https://github.com/Laurent-Smeets-GSS-Account/RGhana).

# Quick Overview

## Column 1

### Outline
R is rapidly becoming the standard platform for data manipulation, visualization and analysis and has a number of advantages over other statistical software packages. A wide community of users contribute to R, resulting in an enormous coverage of statistical procedures, including many that are not available in any other statistical program. Furthermore, it is highly flexible for programming and scripting purposes, for example when manipulating data or creating professional plots. However, R lacks standard GUI menus, as in SPSS for example, from which to choose what statistical test to perform or which graph to create. As a consequence, R is more challenging to master. Therefore, this course offers an introduction to statistical programming in R. Students learn to operate R, make plots, and do advanced statistical programming and data manipulation. 


The course starts at a very basic level and builds up gradually. No previous experience with R is required.

# Installing R + RStudio

## Column 1

### **1. Install `R`**
`R` can be obtained [here](https://cran.r-project.org). We won't use `R` directly in the course, but rather call `R` through `RStudio`. Therefore will it need to be installed. 

### **2. Install `RStudio` Desktop**

Rstudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It can be obtained as stand-alone software [here](https://www.posit.co/downloads/). The free and open source `RStudio Desktop` version is sufficient.

### **3. Start RStudio and install the following packages. **

Execute the following lines of code in the console window:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c("stats", "tidyverse", "magrittr", "knitr", 
                   "rmarkdown", "plotly", "shiny", "readxl",
                   "janitor", "lubridate", "writexl", "devtools", 
                   "boot", "class", "car", "MASS", 
                   "ISLR", "DAAG", "mice", "sf"), 
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```


If you are not sure where to execute code, use the following figure to identify the console:

<center>
  <img src="assets/console.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" width = 50%>
</center>

Just copy and paste the installation command and press the return key. When asked 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
Do you want to install from sources the package which needs 
compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
```

type `Yes` in the console and press the return key.

# Loops and Functions

## Column 1

### Week 5 -- Loops and Functions

We'll now focus on loops and functions for the next two weeks. Loops allow you to replace repetitive sections of code that would be tedious or impossible to write without them. Functions allow you to re-use code that you write, and are especially useful for saving time on common tasks. They are also much easier to debug than copy-pasted code.

### Additional material

The following references are currently available for free, either as pdfs or as extensive webpages (written with [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)). They are all very useful and we highly recommend them. 

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz): written by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund this book relies almost exclusively on the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) approach to data analysis. Many highly effective tools will be right at your fingertips after reading this book and working through the many exercises.
- [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/): a great read by Garrett Grolemund emphasizing programming techniques with R. 
- [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/): You want to gain deeper knowledge of R and you wnat to learn from one of the most influential R contributors. This one is for you!
- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/): an introductory book on statistical learning, with applications in R. The R code is somewhat old-style and you might be able to find newer packages for the tasks, but ths is a solid read well worth the effort.
- [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR ](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html): a great introduction to version control using Git and GitHub together with RStudio. Written by Jenny Bryan in a very concise style. Highly recommended!



# Additional Material

### Introduction
I am always available for any questions, so always feel free to come by my office.

Your own motivation and dedication will determine how much progress you make. The more time you invest in learning R, the better you will get of course! Therefore, I would like this progress to be very much driven by what you want to learn, so please come up with topics to discuss yourself as well and I will adjust the assignments and discussions based on that.
